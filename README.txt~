Browsing the navigation examples:

Navigation examples can be found under doc folder in subfolder navigationExamples. Browsing examples can be started from loginExample.html. By pressing login, a draft of employee listing is shown. Button to show employee can be pressed to see how the employees are going to be shown. From this screen, the edit button can be pressed to see how the edit and create new screen is going to look like. Interview & candidate index, show, edit and create screens are going to be similar and therefore there are no separate examples for them.
